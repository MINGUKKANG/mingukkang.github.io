I am currently pursuing my Ph.D degress at at the Graduate School of AI at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/), where I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) under the supervision of Prof. [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info/). I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering from Pusan National University. 

My research interests primarily focus on computer vision, particularly in the area of generative modeling. I am interested in exploring the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to facilitate a wide range of vision applications. If you are interested in my research projects, please feel free to contact me.
