I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Graduate School of AI at [POSTECH](https://postech.ac.kr/eng/), where I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) under the supervision of Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io) (2023–present). Previously, I was part of the same lab under the supervision of Prof. [Jaesik Park](https://jaesik.info/) (2020–2023). From 2022 to 2024, I interned at Adobe Research, collaborating with wonderful colleagues: [Taesung Park](https://taesung.me/), [Jun-Yan Zhu](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junyanz/), [Richard Zhang](https://richzhang.github.io/), [Eli Shechtman](https://research.adobe.com/person/eli-shechtman/), [Sylvain Paris](https://research.adobe.com/person/sylvain-paris/), and [Connelly Barnes](https://www.connellybarnes.com/work/), where my research contributed to the development of Firefly. Previously, I received my B.S. in Engineering from Pusan National University.

Starting in November 2024, I joined Pika as a Founding Research Scientist, expanding my experience in video generation.

My research focuses on computer vision, particularly visual generative modeling and its applications. I am fascinated by the diverse range of vision-related tasks that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can assist with. I am also interested in training large-scale diffusion models and exploring their applications. If you would like to know more about my research projects, please feel free to reach out to me.
